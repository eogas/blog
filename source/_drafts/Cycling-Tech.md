Last fall, for no apparent reason, I decided to start getting back into cycling. I had a basic Raleigh road bike sitting in my living room that I bought back in college, and I hadn't ridden it since...well since college.

Long story short (maybe I'll write a dedicated post about it someday), I have started riding pretty regularly again. And in doing so, I've been sucked into the bottomless money hole of cool cycling technology and gadgets. It turns out that the world of cycling tech has changed drastically in the past 10 years.
