title: One Year of (Slightly) Healthier Eating

This will be a two-part post, with the first and second parts being written one year apart. Today's date is Saturday, May 11th, 2019, and it is the weekend following my 30th birthday.

Since my early 20s, I have been overweight. Not just overweight in fact, with a BMI over 30 at the time of writing, [I am considered obese by the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/adult/defining.html). I won't go into how it happened, nor will I catalog any failed attempts to lose the weight, because this isn't particularly interesting. What I aim to do instead is describe a weight loss technique that I wish to try now, and a year from now I will follow up with how well (or poorly) it went.

# A Few Simple Rules
Every single fat person (I may be overgeneralizing here) wants to know how to lose weight without having to do a bunch of work. I know I do. And while this may be asking for too much, I think I can increase my chances of success by at least reducing the amount of *mental* work required.

To remove as much mental work as possible, I will define a strict, yet simple, set of rules related to my calorie intake. I will live by these rules for a year, and I'll publish the results at the end. The theory here is that if I do a few simple things that are hard for a long enough period of time, they should eventually become second nature.

### 1. [No drinky no calorie plz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_o3iDHdBTI)
The first rule is clear and simple. I also expect it to have the greatest impact. Sugary and/or alcoholic drinks currently make up a nontrivial amount of the total calories I consume, and I think it should be relatively simple to cut these out entirely.

For the next year, the valid options will be water, black coffee, unsweetened selzer, and unsweetened tea.

To avoid weird conversations with friends and family, I will likely make a few exceptions for special events and vacations, but in my day to day, **absolutely no calories in liquid form**.

### 2. No fast food
This one is more subjective. What constitutes fast food? What about takeout? Delivery?

At the moment, I probably go through a drive-thru window once to twice per week, typically on the way home from work. This is terrible, and is the primary behavior I want to cut out with this rule. For the purposes of this exercise **any restaurant with a drive-thru is considered fast food**.

But what about takeout? I live in Allston, which is a neighborhood in Boston known for having a ton of awesome restaurants lining the streets. There's even a [yearly festival](https://www.tasteofallston.com/) to celebrate the restaurant culture of the neighborhood. Virtually every restaurant in the area offers takeout and delivery. To keep things simple, I'll employ a rule that **takeout (on foot) is okay, delivery is not**.

If I want to get food from a restaurant, I have to actually walk there to go get it. No delivery, no takeout in the car, and certainly no drive-thru.

### 3. Grocery shopping once a week
To help bolster the previous rule, I have also made it a rule that I have to go grocery shopping at least once per week. It's easy for me to get into a mindset where I'm driving home and I think:

{% blockquote Evan's inner monologue in the car on the way home from work %}
Hm, I don't have any food at home. What am I going to eat tonight? I guess I *have* to go grab some fast food on the way home.
{% endblockquote %}

I hope that this inner monologue changes over time. Instead of driving to get some fast food, it should become second nature to drive to a grocery store instead. To keep this rule simple, for now I am not factoring in specifically buying healthy foods.

### 4. Stand on the scale every day
This is another clear cut one. Some people recommend against very frequent weigh-ins while losing weight, because seeing the changes in weight from day to day for various reasons can make you feel discouraged.

That's not really my personality, and I want to be able to record and visualize my weight over time. More weigh-ins means more data, so I'll be weighing myself every day. I own an overpriced smart scale that automatically syncs data to my phone, and then to the cloud, so there's really no excuse not to do this.

### 5. No fail no stoppy plz
{% blockquote %}
Failure is not an option.
{% endblockquote %}

You know who said that? Some guy who failed probably.

The ethos I'll be following during this experiment is that failure is not only an option, it is pretty much a certainty. No one is perfect, we all make mistakes, etc and so forth, additional hackneyed motivational cliches.

I say this not as a trite motivational tool, but as a reality. The experiment continues on without me. If I do great for a few weeks then go on a month long binge where I consume a diet made up entirely of big macs (ugh), it's fair game to pick things up again after I get back from the hospital. This is an experiment, not a specific goal and not a challenge. It will be challeng*ing*, but there is no metric for success or failure.

I hope that everything goes well and I lose some weight, but if I don't, I've still learned something. And that's what I'll cover in part 2.
