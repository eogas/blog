A few years back I started getting back into cycling in a big way. I may do a full writeup about that journey some day, but this post is just about a big ride I took last weekend.

My family had planned to get together at my grandmother's house in Lyons, WI, a tiny town West of Burlington. This tiny town happens to sit right on the [White River State Trail](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/whiteriver), a crushed limestone trail that runs from Elkhorn to Burlington (and a little bit further East). My family often walks on this trail when visiting my grandma for holidays. Given that I've been riding [farther and faster lately](https://www.strava.com/activities/9297804504), I wondered if it might be fun to ride to the family get together rather than driving.

### Route Planning

I got to work in the [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/) route planner. The automatically generated routes all insisted on taking Forest Home Ave. for a big part of the route. While this is the most direct route, it's certainly not the safest nor the most pleasant. After quite a bit of tweaking, I was able to coerce the route onto more low traffic roads and off-street trails without pushing too close to the 100 mile mark.

I knew that this route included some crushed limestone trails, and some other offroad sections of unknown quality, so I opted for my gravel bike. And since I didn't want to hang out with the fam in lycra and cycling shoes, I threw on my [Road Runner](https://roadrunnerbags.us/) bikepacking bags, and packed them with shoes, a change of clothes, and plenty of snacks.

### Leaving Bay View

I started in Bay View on the [KK River Trail](https://city.milwaukee.gov/dpw/infrastructure/multimodal/Bike-Infrastructure/Trails/KK-River-Trail). It's barely a trail, but the Southern section was useful on this ride for getting out of the neighborhood quickly. From there I transferred to the [KK River Parkway](https://county.milwaukee.gov/files/county/parks-department/Park-Maps/KKRivPkwy_E1.pdf).

Unfortunately there's no nice transition here. The official bike route says to take W Manitoba St, but I opted to take W Cleveland Ave because it looked better maintained on Google Maps, and mostly allowed me to avoid 6th St. It ended up working fine.

### Leaving Milwaukee

Then I did have to hop on Forest Home Ave. for a while, as the parkway just continues on West. This is really the only busy road in the whole route. Forest Home eventually intersects with the relatively new [Powerline Trail](https://www.powerlinetrail.org/). This trail is a great resource, but it would benefit greatly from some foliage to give some protection from the wind and sun.

After the Powerline Trail, I continued on a bit further West to get to 116th St. This turned out to be a great choice, as there was very little traffic on this road on a Saturday. And with a quick hop onto S North Cape Road (yes, South North...), it runs right into the [City of Franklin Hike and Bike Trail](https://www.traillink.com/trail/city-of-franklin-hike-and-bike-trail-(route-of-the-badger)/) for a mile and a half. Then it turns back into 116th St. again, albeit with a bit of a more country road style on this part. There is an elevated, overgrown service road along this portion of 116th that looks like it might even be rideable. Though it also looks like it might be private property.

### The Seven Waters Trail

From 116th I zig-zagged on W Ryan Road and N Cape Rd to finally reach the [Seven Waters Trail](https://www.traillink.com/trail-maps/seven-waters-bike-trail-(route-of-the-badger\)). As soon as I turned onto this trail I knew the gravel bike was the right choice. The start of this trail is pretty chunky gravel on top of dirt, with some decently loose gravel on the edges. Defintiely not road-bikeable, but I had no major problems on 38c tires. I did at one point have some difficulty remounting my bike in the loose stuff on the way back, but aside from this it was fine as long as I was already rolling.

The gravel changes to crushed limestone after a bit, which was much smoother. This trail goes for quite a while, with a couple of transitions to either side of state highway 36. Toward the Southern end of the trail it cuts through a wooded area in [Saller Woods](https://goo.gl/maps/Fs5pgXUmKBEzbkSq5). This section is short, but it was a lot of fun to ride. (It's also where I took the cool bridge shot above)

### Burlington

The Seven Waters Trail eventually just dumps you out into Burlington. The suggested routes all have you taking the main streets through town to get to the other side. But I figured there had to be a better way. Indeed, I found a way.

There is a secret trail that starts at the West edge of [Sunset Park](https://goo.gl/maps/Tdqr9asLnYgTRq8R8). It runs behind a couple blocks of houses, then turns into this epic gravel rollercoaster along the edge of a quarry for a bit. It was super fun on the gravel bike. I definitely had to take it slow in some spots to not lose traction.

### White River State Trail

From there it's just one more quick road stint to cross a bridge, then you're at the trailhead for the [White River State Trail](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/whiteriver)...which I did not realize was a state trail before doing this ride. Whoops! I totally forgot to bring my trail pass. I'll have to remember that for next time.

This trail is beautiful. It's crushed limestone and smooth dirt for the section I rode, but I believe this is true for the whole trail. Great tree coverage, so you're not baking in the sun or getting blasted by the wind. There are several water crossings, and this is rural farmland. So the views are great.

I cruised these last couple of miles to my grandmother's house. I made such good time on the way there that I was actually the first to arrive. I wasn't in too terrible shape for having ridden 44 miles in near 90 degree weather.

### The Long Ride Home

After hanging out with the family for about 4 hours, and eating as many carbs as I could find, I packed up and headed home. I traced back the exact same route in reverse. I thought my main problem was going to be the heat, as it was 90 degrees when I left for home. But this relented quickly as the sun began to get lower in the sky.

What really made the ride feel long was just the stress of being on the bike for so many hours. Presumably this was exacerbated by the rough gravel on the Northern end of the Seven Waters Trail. When I first hit the gravel on the way down, I was smiling from ear to ear. But when I finally hit pavement again on the way back, I couldn't have been happier to be done on the gravel.

I felt the stress on my body, and I thought I was building up fatigue. But as I rode further on the pavement, I actually started to feel better and better. I think around the time I got back on Forest Home I was feeling pretty good again, and I was even riding harder. I don't think it was a nutrition thing, as I was still taking in carbs the whole way home. It could have been a temperature thing, or maybe just the terrain. But by the end of the ride, I honestly felt like I could have kept going.

Maybe this is a lesson in riding. I feel like I have heard people who I follow talk about having ups and downs in rides, and trying to remember that if you feel bad on a ride, it will pass. Is that what happened to me on this ride? Was it just a mental thing? Maybe just knowing that the end of the ride was near made me feel better. I really don't know, but it was an interesting experience to be sure. Maybe I can use this knowledge in future long rides.

Anyway that's it for this one. I know it was a long one, but so was the ride.
