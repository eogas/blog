Recently I saw a Facebook post from my cousin that caught my eye. He said that he would be reading 52
books this year, one book per week. This resonated with me when I saw it. I like reading, and I like
the idea of a well-defined, easily validated goal.

Don't get me wrong, I do not have the willpower to read a book every week. However, I was inspired enough
to aim for a similar goal of my own. Last weekend I created a rough list of 12 books on a post-it note that
I will aim to read this year. The full list is:

* **Jan** - What's the Matter with Kansas - Thomas Frank
* **Feb** - Don Quixote - Miguel de Cervantes
* **Mar** - Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In - Bernie Sanders
* **Apr** - We - Yevgeny Zamyatin
* **May** - Scar Tissue - Anthony Kiedis
* **Jun** - On the Road - Jack Kerouac
* **Jul** - God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything - Christopher Hitchens
* **Aug** - Breakfast of Champions - Kurt Vonnegut
* **Sep** - The Inmates Are Running the Asylum: Why High Tech Products Drive Us Crazy and How to Restore the Sanity - Alan Cooper
* **Oct** - The Great Gatsby - F. Scott Fitzgerald
* **Nov** - Walden - Henry David Thoreau
* **Dec** - Love in the Time of Cholera - Gabriel García Márquez

I may end up swapping one or two out here and there, but this seems like pretty good starting point to me. The
list alternates between fiction and nonfiction, and I've attempted to keep a reasonbly varied selection
to keep things interesting.

The main goal here is to keep myself reading, and I have created a similar goal to attempt to keep myself
blogging, so keep an eye out for monthly posts about each book at the very least. I'm currently wrapping up
What's the Matter with Kansas, so there will be a post about it in the works very soon.

Apart from that, stay tuned for some posts that are actually about software development maybe?
