Apparently the thing to do in 2020 while we're all cooped up inside is to learn how to bake bread. Now that the initial run on bread flour has tempered a bit, I decided to give it a try.

I ordered a few bags of flour, looked up a couple of [recipes on the King Arthur website](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/the-easiest-loaf-of-bread-youll-ever-bake-recipe), and eventually I was able to make something that resembles a legit loaf of bread. Check it out!
