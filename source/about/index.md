My name is Evan and I'm a software developer. I currently live and work in the Boston area. 
I enjoy [building DIY guitar pedals](https://old.reddit.com/r/diypedals/), homebrewing, [cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/47504891), and buying [way too many books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/33671846-evan) (technical and nontechnical alike).

I mostly listen to [math rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHLWGRJwA28), [post-rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YHmNvbR4rQ&list=PLGOeAR_q_bV0xRzfarhOTteCTWZ-6lGTe), and [post-hardcore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeQNkai9LSk).
