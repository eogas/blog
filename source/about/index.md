My name is Evan and I'm a software developer. I currently live and work in the Boston area. 
I like [building DIY guitar pedals](https://old.reddit.com/r/diypedals/) and buying books that I will never read. Also [Midwest Emo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3zXiYkJIGU).

I can be found on [twitter](https://twitter.com/eOgas) and [github](https://github.com/eogas).

This blog was developed using [hexo](https://hexo.io/) with the [hacker](https://github.com/CodeDaraW/Hacker) theme. It also uses [hexo-reading-time](https://github.com/ierhyna/hexo-reading-time) to display average reading length for my posts.
